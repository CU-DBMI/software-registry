# CU DBMI Wall of Software

### [✨ **VIEW THE WALL**](https://CU-DBMI.github.io/wall-of-software)

The [Department of Biomedical Informatics (DBMI) at the University of Colorado](https://medschool.cuanschutz.edu/dbmi) investigates complex problems in medicine and biology using integrated computational technology.
This repository and website contains a non-comprehensive list of tools, packages, workflows, resources, and other software that have been developed by our diverse group researchers, scientists, developers, and collaborators in support of [our mission](https://medschool.cuanschutz.edu/dbmi/about-us).

## Submit

If you work for or with the department, you are eligible to submit your software or group here.

To submit your **software**, [open a pull request in this repo](https://github.com/CU-DBMI/wall-of-software/pulls) with the following changes:

- Add an _entry_ to **the top** of `list.json`.
  - A short ~3-20 char name.
  - A short ~20-80 char description.
  - A link to a website or repo.
- Add a _web-friendly_ image to `/images`.
  - Filename is lowercase, kebab-case version of entry name, e.g. _Word Lapse_ → `word-lapse`.
  - PNG with extension of `.png`.
  - 600px × 600px.

To submit your **group**, make the same changes, except use `groups.json` and `/groups`.

Shortly after opening a PR, a link should appear to a preview of the site with your changes.

Entries are shuffled randomly on each page visit!

## Printed

If you'd also like your software or group to be printed out and posted on the wall of the DBMI office (6th floor Anschutz Health Sciences Building), submit the following changes:

- Add a _printable_ image to `/print`.
  - Filename should be lowercase, kebab-case version of entry name.
  - Should have extension `.png`.
  - Conforms to the [4" × 4" hexagon template here](https://www.stickermule.com/uses/hexagon-stickers).

## Image Guidelines

- Look at existing entries and [hexb.in](http://hexb.in/) for inspiration!
- Enough margins for main content to fit nicely inside hexagon.
- _Web-friendly_ version ideally doesn't contain text.
  Why?
  More visually appealing, more consistent, more intriguing, and website already displays name text as needed.
